# Calculator

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course curriculum. 

Live demo here: https://shnaboi.github.io/Calculator/

Calculator was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript

I modeled the functionality and display of this project from the standard Windows OS calculator app. In the app, there are many ways to continue and chain together long equations: 
- Chain long equations together without pressing equal, but instead by pressing the next operator button (add, subtract, multiply, divide). 
- Introduce new math operations onto the answer of a previous equation. 
- Continually press the equals button to let the answer become the new variable for the equation. 
- After given the answer to an equation, you can simply input a new number, press equals, and it will calculate the previous equation but with the new input. 

These bullet points were the hardest bugs for me to resolve while finishing the project.
